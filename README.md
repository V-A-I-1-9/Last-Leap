## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js & npm**: For the frontend.
- **Python 3.x & pip**: For the backend.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.

### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

3.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    *(Note: A `requirements.txt` is recommended. Based on `app.py`, you'll need at least these.)*
    ```bash
    pip install Flask Flask-Cors Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-JWT-Extended Flask-Bcrypt python-dotenv google-generativeai google-api-python-client xhtml2pdf markdown markdown-it-py
    ```

5.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add your API keys:
    ```env
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"
    YOUTUBE_API_KEY="YOUR_YOUTUBE_API_KEY"
    JWT_SECRET_KEY="YOUR_SUPER_SECRET_JWT_KEY" # Can be any long, random string
    ```

6.  **Run the backend server:**
    The Flask server will start, and the database `study_plan.db` will be created automatically.
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    The backend will be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev  # Or `npm start` depending on the project setup
    ```
    The frontend will be running at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port specified in the output). Open this URL in your browser to use the application.
